# cargofly-mvc

This project is based on my custom MVC pattern-based framework. Requires tones of improvements.

For now the whole app is working, except live feature (real-time cargo tracking) which I may write in React. 

The structure consists of: Controllers,Forms (with form builder and form validator), Fixtures, Entites, Repositories, Services and templates (at the beginning views were based on custom classes, but eventually I decided to use Twig).



FLEET PAGE:
Displays paginated list of all named planes available. Models are taken from aeroplane (another) list. Results can be sorted by columns and filtered by search form.
